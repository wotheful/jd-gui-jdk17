# JD-GUI

JD-GUI, a standalone graphical utility that displays Java sources from class files.

This is a fork of the original JD-Core project, which is no longer maintained. I tried to fix and update dependencies to make it live longer and be useful for the community. If you have a good knowledge of Java and want to help, feel free to contribute. 😃
